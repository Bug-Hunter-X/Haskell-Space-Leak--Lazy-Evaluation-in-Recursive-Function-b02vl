This code suffers from a space leak due to the lazy evaluation in Haskell. The `calculate` function recursively calls itself, but the intermediate results are not explicitly forced. In a scenario where a large number of intermediate results need to be calculated, Haskell might not garbage collect these intermediate results immediately, leading to a space leak.  This is especially problematic for deeply recursive calls.

```haskell
calculate :: Int -> Int
calculate 0 = 0
calculate n = n + calculate (n - 1)
```
